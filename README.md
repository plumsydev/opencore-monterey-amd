# OpenCore configuration made for the AMD Ryzen (1xxx-3xxx & 5xxx) generation

### Ryzen 5 5500
### RX 6600

## If another CPU than the R5 5500 is used, the AMD Kernel Patch used for it will need some changes in the config.plist of OpenCore
## Please read these docs -> https://github.com/AMD-OSX/AMD_Vanilla?tab=readme-ov-file#read-me-first <-

Will most likely work on another PC with same specs.
 OS : Monterey (possible upgrade to Ventura & Sonoma)
